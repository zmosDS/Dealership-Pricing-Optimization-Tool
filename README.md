# US Automotive Market Insights

## Overview
US Automotive Market Insights aims to gather and analyze car pricing data across the United States to uncover trends and identify good values. The project focuses on collecting data from the top 10 car manufacturers in the US, covering car listings from 2010 to 2024. By scraping data from Cars.com, the project compiles a comprehensive dataset of used car listings from across the United States.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- `Web-Scraper/`: Contains the web scraper code and related documentation.
- `Data-Analysis/`: Contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling notebooks.
  - `EDA/`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
  - `price-recommender/`: Contains the price recommendation system, including data cleaning, model comparison, optimization, and a GUI for price recommendations.
  - `depreciation-analysis/`: Contains the analysis of car depreciation from 2010 to 2024, including different makes and types (gas, EV).
- `data/`: Contains sample raw and processed data used in the analyses.
